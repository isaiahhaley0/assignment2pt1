**Description**:  App uses Vue.js to interact with google books api and display books and information about books, such as 
rating and available formats.

The additional fields that I added to  the search results are the formats the book is availaible in and a rating, that also displays a star rating. The star rating is automatically selected and displays the proper star rating to within half a star.
